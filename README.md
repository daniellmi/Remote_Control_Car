# Remote Control Car with Arduino and MIT App Inventor

This project is a remote control car built using an Arduino board and a custom Android app developed with MIT App Inventor. The app communicates with the car via Bluetooth, allowing full control of movement.

## ðŸš— Features

- Control car movements: forward, backward, left, right, and stop
- Bluetooth communication between Arduino and Android device
- Simple and intuitive mobile interface

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Arduino MEGA 2560** (or compatible)
- **L298N Motor Driver**
- **Bluetooth module HC-05**
- **MIT App Inventor** for Android app

## ðŸ“± App Interface

The app includes buttons for each movement, connected to Bluetooth commands sent to the Arduino.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The app connects to the HC-05 via Bluetooth.
2. User presses a button (e.g., Forward).
3. The app sends a character via Bluetooth (like `'F'` for forward).
4. The Arduino reads the command and activates the motors accordingly.
